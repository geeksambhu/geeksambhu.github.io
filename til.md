#### How to stash untracked files in `git`?

`git stash -u` stash the untracked files in git without adding files to staging area
New versions of `git` now have `git stash --all` which stashes all files, including untracked and ignored files.
`git stash --include-untracked` no longer touches ignored files

#### What is the difference between `json.dump()` and `json.dumps()` in 
python?

`json.dump` takes file stream and will dump into a file stream while 
`json.dumps` takes string argument and often used for printing parsing 
etc. `json.dumps` == `dump string` :D

Wrote a blog and a script to Organize Desktop and group similar files in a Directory

  ``` echo '\n#### ' `date` ``` appends UNIX commands  `date` to string in shell  

#### How to check if a string endswith any of the elements from a list in python?
     
  > such list of string  must be `tuple`  for that purpose

```python

>>> photos_extension = ("jpg", "JPEG", "jpeg","png","HEIC","svg","JPG")
>>> file_name = "picofNepal.jpg"
>>> file_name.endswith(photos_extension)
True

```

#### How to redirect to `https` from `http` using Flask `url_for()` ?

> Since Flask `url_for` does not respect `http` or `https` while redirecting, always use `redirect(url_for('func_name', _external=True))` to respect the root `URL` and 
Scheme(`http` or `https`) Used

#### How to remotely execute remote bash script in remote machine from local machine?

>  To remotely execute a script residing in remote machine, do this:

`ssh username@host.address './remotescript.sh'`

On doing so remote script is executed however node module are not found and executed hence to execute the npm tools like `pm2` follow the following steps:

1. Type the following commands in your remote machine:" `echo $PATH`"
        It will output results like below:
"``/home/ubuntu/bin:/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:/home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.4/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/sn$``"

2. Copy the above output and open the file with texteditor like `nano remotescript.sh`  and add the new line at the start of file. The new line must be like :
"`export PATH='{step 1 Output}'`"
remember that the `{step 1 Output}` looks like this `/home/ubuntu/bin:/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:/home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.4/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin$`

3. Now save and close the file and execute your remote file like below:
                
    `ssh username@host.address './remotescript.sh'` 

CONGRATS!!!, You just ran your remote script in remote machine from local machine: let me know if any problem occurs :)

#### How to find the length of a `set` in `javascript`?

> Use `set_variable.size` like below:

    var setTempVariable = new Set([1,2,3,4])
    console.log(setTempVariable.size) // Outputs 4

#### How to use or operator in regex to match either group?

> I had a use case to match either a number or a fixed string which I did by 
using following regex:
       
      `((^[0-9]+$)|FIXED$)`

Using `+` and `$` helped me to exact match either of the group i.e number or 
'FIXED' string. + looks for 0 or 1 repetition while $ matched the end of string

#### Simple Mail server for debugging in python
 
  ```python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n <source_address>:<port>```

If default `mailserver` will be enable in port `localhost:8025`, Anything sent to this address and port will be sent in STDOUT
  
Happy Email debugging Folks:

```bash
telnet localhost 25
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 Shivas-Macbook.local Python SMTP proxy version 0.2
helo localhost #To connect
250 Shivas-Macbook.local
mail from: username@mymail.com # From
250 Ok
rcpt to: shivaji@@mymail.com #receipent
250 Ok
data #data to send message
354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
Subject: Hello
Hello,
This is sample test
Me
.
```
End telnet with a `.` at the end

In STDOUT after sending message from `telnet`
:

```bash
python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n

---------- MESSAGE FOLLOWS ----------
Subject: Hello
Hello,
This is sample test
Me
------------ END MESSAGE ------------
```

### How to exclude files and folders when compressing using `tar`?

Use `--exclude` as many times you like to exclude files and folders.


```bash 
 cd <directory> #DIrectory in which you want to compress the files and folders
 tar --exclude='./node_modules' --exclude='.excluding_folder_name' --exclude='./test.py' --exclude='./env' -czvf excluded.tar.gz .
```

### Removing Sensitive information from git

```bash
  git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch -r <FILE_NAME_OR_FOLDER_IF_FOLDER_-r_AS_ARGS>" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

This will Force Git to process, but not check out, the entire history of every branch and tag, Remove the specified file, as well as any empty commits generated as a 
result, Add file or folder to `.gitignore` once removed to ensure you won't commit again

    if request.headers['Origin'] in white_list_url:
        response.headers.add('Content-Type', 'application/json')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', request.headers['Origin'] )
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type,Authorization')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Expose-Headers', 'Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization,X-Pagination')

#### Learn ways to initialize vector in Rust
    
1. Using `vec!` macro 
2. Using `new()` 
    
    ````rust
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
     ````
3. Using `with_capacity` 

   ````rust
    let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(10);
     ````
4. To sort vector using `sort_unstable` it uses https://github.com/orlp/pdqsort and this https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.sort_unstable

    ````rust
    let mut nums = vec![-1,-5,-3,1,2,-1];
    nums.sort_unstable();
    ````

###  Tue Feb 8 23:28:16 +0545 2022
### Rust: Declaring constant
      
        For constant declaration one must include `Data Types` and `const` doesn't allow to use `mut`. 

      ```rust
      const NUM:u8 =8;
      ````

###  Thu Feb 17 13:21:02 +0545 2022
### Rust: Array slice

   For slicing an array use type signature &[T]

   ```Rust
   #[test]
    fn slice_out_of_array() {
        let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        let nice_slice = &a[1..4];

        assert_eq!([2, 3, 4], nice_slice)
        
        }
   ```

Tuple indexing in rust
 access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value to access.
  ```Rust
  let numbers = (1, 2, 3);
  let second = numbers.1 ; //2
  ```
